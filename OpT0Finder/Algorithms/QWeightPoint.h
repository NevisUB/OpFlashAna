     \class QWeightPoint
     Implementation of flashana::BaseFlashHypothesis algorithm class. \n
     Given a TPC object (flashana::QCluster_t), it calcultes a list of flash hypothesis \n
     points based on charge deposition and its geometrical position. Each energy deposition \n
     point is weighted by its charge and inverse-squared-x position. As the absolute \n
     x-position is not known by a TPC object, it uses a relative position for each point \n
     w.r.t. the closest point to the wire plane (x=0). The algorithm then assigns an overall \n
     absolute x-position offset in a successive step of _x_step_size value, assigned by a user, \n
     to compute possible flash hypothesis points.\n
